# MathHub Intellectual Property

MathHub.info builds on a solid legal framework: the
[Creative Commons licenses](http://creativecommons.org/licenses). The authors retain
copyright for their works and license them to the community. In particular, when
submitting any documents to MathHub.info, the authors agree to the following licensing
scheme:

  - If the authors use a *public MathHub repository*, then the content (including source)
    will be licensed under a
    [CC Attribution-Sharealike license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa).
  - If the author uses a *private repository* (**document escrow**), then the content will
    be made public and licensed under a
    [CC Attribution-Sharealike license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses) after three
    months (unless the authors choose to prolong escrow).

The document escrow provision is designed to give the mathematical community access to the
documents after the authors no longer care enough to prolong the escrow. This will build a
*content commons* of flexiformal, active documents.

Users will be notified of imminent escrow expiry ahead of time, escrow can be prolonged by
a simple mouse click, and users can withdraw content or even delete private repositories
to avoid content becoming public.
