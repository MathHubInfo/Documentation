# MDDL

MDDL (Math Data Description Language) is a mathematical data description language MDDL and was
first described in [BKR](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-23250-4_3).
It uses symbolic data to specify the semantics of relational data. 
MDDL schemas combine the low-level schemas of relational database with high-level specifications 
(which critically use symbolic mathematical data) of the mathematical types of the data in the tables.
