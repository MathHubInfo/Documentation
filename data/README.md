# MathHub Data

MathHub Data is a unified infrastructure to support FAIR mathematical research data.  
Specifically, it aims to support the usual kind of data -- data that conform to the relational data model, 
in contrast to, for example, formalised mathematics or research papers.  
MathHub Data builds on and is a part of the MathHub portal for narrative and symbolic mathematical data.
The datasets are available as virtual theories. 
These abstract from the storage level and are well-integrated with mathematical documents and knowledge on MathHub.

The infrastructure provided by MathHub Data includes storage and a searchable interface for datasets. 
The team is setting up a dataset [submission process](overview/submission-editorial.md) that will involve peer review, 
and thus improve the reliability of published data.

- **Dataset authors** can specify the meaning of mathematical objects and their database encoding via 
[MDDL schema theories](overview/MDDL), based on mathematical background knowledge already on MathHub,
- **Users** can interact with data set objects as with any other objects on MathHub via the MathHub front-end, tools, and APIs. 

The MathHub Data setup ensures 
- long-term availability of the data 
- user interfaces, APIs, and interoperability at the database level **and the mathematical level** 
- [license](overview/IntellectualProperty.md) and [provenance](provenance) management.
