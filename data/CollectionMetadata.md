# Collection Metadata

- `schemaTheoryURL` - the URL of the schema theory.
- `authors` - a string containing the list of authors.
- `references` - a list of references.

## References

References are JSON objects with the following three fields. They are used to generate a list of references on the collection about page.
- `type` - doi/web/other (for showing an icon by the link or similar).
- `title` - the linked text (we may add a description later).
- `url` - the link itself.
