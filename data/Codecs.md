This is a list of codecs compiled at the math data workshop and should be considered in [codec consolidation](https://github.com/MathHubInfo/mdh_django/issues/7).

## (Nearly/Mostly) Existing

* booleans: true-false, 0-1
* integers: standard as db integers, integers as strings, integers as lists of base64 digits
* polynomial: as sparse array (one variable, flattened list of pairs)
* matrix: list of lists operator (by row, column, flattened)
* vector: list
* set: as list or ordered list
* complex datatypes and codec operators: polynomials

## Elementary/Wanted

* rational numbers
* complex numbers
* real numbers
* algebraic numbers
* permutations (of integers/arbitrary sets)
* graphs
* graph extensions such as maniplexes

## Hard

* permutation groups
* finitely presented groups
* named groups
* incompleteness (minimal set, an example that exists but might not be minimal)

## Figure out nice opaque

* relator (word composed of Coxeter string group generators rho_i (well known in community))
