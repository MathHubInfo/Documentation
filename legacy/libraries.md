# MathHub Libraries

The top level of organization in [MathHub.info](https://mathhub.info) consists of
libraries (described here) and [[user spaces|user-spaces]].

A MathHub library is a public resource of flexiformal documents (e.g. a theorem prover
library, a mathematical terminology base, or a logic atlas). MathHub libraries are usually
developed and maintained by a community, either directly on
[MathHub.info](https://mathhub.info), or imported from an external library for archiving.

A MathHub library is established by the [[MathHub library committee|library-committee]]
and consists of a set of MathHub [[math archives|math-archives]] that contain the contents
of the resource, metadata, and documentation about the resource.

Technically, a MathHub library corresponds to a GitLab group with a
MathHub-specific layout:

1.  The [[metadata repository|metadata]] `meta-inf` for library-level metadata and documentation
2.  a set of [[math archives|math-archives]] that contain the [[flexiformal content|FlexiForms]].

The set of libraries in MathHub can be found [here](https://mathhub.info/#/content).
