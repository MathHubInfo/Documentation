# MathHub Data Collections

A **mathematical data colletion** is a regular [MathHub Library](libraries) with [MDDL schema theories](MDDL). 
It consists of 
- **MDDL archives** for the schema theories. The main one is usually just called `mddl`.
- **VT archives** for the virtual theories generated from the `mddl` archive, the main one is usually called `vt`   
 
An example of a MDDL-based schema collection can be seen in MathHub ([MDDL](https://gl.mathhub.info/symmetric-objects/mddl), [VT](https://gl.mathhub.info/symmetric-objects/vt), and the [generated data collection _Symmetric Objects_](https://mathhub.info/library/group?id=symmetric-objects)).
