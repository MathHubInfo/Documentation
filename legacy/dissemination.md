# MathHub Dissemination

To enhance visibility and create an academic reward system for young
researchers, [MathHub](https://mathhub.info) will organize a review
system for formalizations akin to the scientific review system.

  - Open Rating System for [FlexiForms](FlexiForms)
    
    [MathHub.info](https://mathhub.info) will feature an open rating
    system for [FlexiForms](FlexiForms), which is driven by a
    [/.](http://slashdot.org)-like discussion system.
    [MathHub](https://mathhub.info) members can comment on
    [MathHub](https://mathhub.info) contributions, make suggestions, and
    rate [FlexiForms](https://mathhub.info/FlexiForms) or reviews.
    [MathHub](https://mathhub.info) members can obtain
    [MathHub](https://mathhub.info) karma for writing good (i.e.
    well-rated) reviews. The [MathHub](https://mathhub.info) karma will
    be used in weighting future reviews, so that hopefully a
    [MathHub](https://mathhub.info) meritocracy will develop. [...

  - Readers' Choice List
    
    [MathHub](https://mathhub.info) contributions whose rating exceeds a
    certain threshold will be harvested to a notification board that
    serves as a synchronous dissemination channel for popular
    formalizations. [...

  - [MathHub](https://mathhub.info) Notices
    
    The *[MathHub](https://mathhub.info) Notices* will be an electronic
    periodical dedicated to the formal peer review and dissemination of
    [FlexiForms](FlexiForms). It will be managed by an
    international editorial board, which will also determine the
    publication period and volume size. Both will be restricted, so that
    acceptance rates are competitive with international journals.

    [FlexiForms](FlexiForms) will be reviewed with respect to
    their technical quality, novelty, methodical innovation, and their
    reuse factor.
