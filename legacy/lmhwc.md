# Local MathHub Working Copy

Recall that the [MathHub system](http://mathhub.info/architecture) includes a GitLab installation at <http://gl.mathhub.info> that provides personal and group-based repositories for [[MathHub archives|math-archives]]. MathHub uses [GIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29) for the management and distribution of sources and generated content. 

In particular, libraries and archives can be assembled in the local file system (usually in a folder `~/localmh/MathHub` with subdirectories for the libraries into which the archive repositories are cloned. We call this folder the **local MathHub working copy**. This is the basis for [[local editing workflows|lmh-workflows]] and [[management of restricted content|lmh-workflows]].
