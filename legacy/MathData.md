# MathDataHub
MathHub.info also hosts mathematical data collections (collections of concrete mathematical data sets) and makes them available as virtual theories. These abstract from the storage level and are well-integrated with mathematical documents and knowledge on MathHub: 
- **data set creators** can specify the meaning of mathematical objects and their database encoding via [MDDL schema theories](MDDL), based on mathematical background knowledge already on MathHub
- **data set contributors** can upload extensions to existing data sets via GIT pull requests, subject to GIT access management. 
- **users** can interact with data set objects as with any other objects on MathHub via the MathHub front-end, tools, and APIs. 

The MathDataHub setup ensures 
- long-term availability of the data 
- user interfaces, APIs, and interoperability at the database level **and the mathematical lavel** 
- [license](ip) and [provenance](provenance) management.
