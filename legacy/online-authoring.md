# MathHub Online Authoring and Editing

The online authoring interface currently consists of the
[GitLab Web Editor](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html)
for http://gl.mathhub.info: all archive pages have have an edit link that puts the user
into the web editor, which allows the author to either
* commit directly to the respective branch of the repository (provided she has the
rights) or
* make a pull request that can be merged by a maintainer.
