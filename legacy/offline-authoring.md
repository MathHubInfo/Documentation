# MathHub Offline Authoring and Editing

The offline authoring interface of MathHub relies the [[local mathhub working copy|lmhwc]], which can be edited locally and committed back to MathHub. Note that the MathHub portal is synchronized with the public repositories at [http://gl.mathhub.info](http://gl.mathhub.info), so that commits are directly available to the online interface as well. For details we refer to

1.  [[Organization|gl-organization]] of [http://gl.mathhub.info](http://gl.mathhub.info)
2.  The [[lmh|lmh]] tool for multiple MathHub repositories
3.  [[Authoring Workflows|lmh-workflows]]
