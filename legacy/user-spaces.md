# MathHub User Spaces

The top level of organization in [MathHub.info](https://mathhub.info) consists of user spaces (described here) and [[libraries|libraries]].

A MathHub **user space** is a collection of ([[public or private|ip]]) flexiformal documents associated with a MathHub user account.

Technically, a MathHub user space corresponds to a GitLab name space with a MathHub-specific layout:

1.  The [[metadata repository|metadata]] `meta-inf` for user-space-level metadata and documentation
2.  a set of [[math archives|math-archives]] that contain the[[flexiformal content|FlexiForms]].
