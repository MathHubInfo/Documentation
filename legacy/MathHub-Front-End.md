The Front End of MathHub.info is a web application implemented in the [React](http://reactjs.org) framework. 
In a nutshell, it is a Javascript browser application, which visualizes MathHub content that is either
* served on demand as JSON streams by the [MMT API](https://uniformal.github.io/) or 
* provided statically as JSON files (this is used predominantly for mocking up experimental features). 

Front End development happens [on GitHub](https://github.com/mathhubinfo/frontend).
