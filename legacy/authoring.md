# MathHub Authoring and Editing

All [MathHub.info](https://mathhub.info) content is versioned via
[GIT](http://www.git-scm.org) on http://gl.mathhub.info using the GitLab
repository/project manager.

[[MathHub contributors|roles]] can manage their [[flexiforms|FlexiForms]] either via
the

1.  [[online interface|online-authoring]] for direct
    manipulation via the MathHub web portal or the
2.  [[offline workflow|offline-authoring]] for bulk editing
    and creation synchronized via the revision control system.

The online interface is intended for casual or in-place editing of
[MathHub](https://MathHub.info) contents, while the offline workflow is for
power-users. The two workflows are coordinated by GIT-based distribution facilities (see
the pages for [[MathHub architecture|architecture]] and [[change management|build-system]] for a discussion).
