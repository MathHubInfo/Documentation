# About MathHub.info

MathHub.info is a portal for flexiformal mathematics. It offers a rich interface for reading, writing, managing, and interacting with mathematical documents, data and
knowledge [... more](functionality)

A representation is called [flexiformal](FlexiForms)
(or a [FlexiForm](FlexiForms)), if it represents then
underlying data, knowledge, and document structures at varying levels of
formality; formal content enables machine support and interactivity, but
requires high (initial) investment as prerequisite knowledge needs to be
formalized first. Flexiformalization tries to strike a more balanced
bargain between machine support and formalization costs.

MathHub.info aims to drive down the cost of flexiformalization further by providing

  - [versioned hosting of mathematical data, knowledge, and documents](https://gl.mathhub.info),
  - a community for sharing tools, results, and projects,
  - an [online and offline authoring and document development infrastructure](authoring), and
  - GIT repositories ([public and private escrow](ip)) for mathematical documentation projects

The FlexiForms on MathHub.info can be accessed via [Libraries](https://mathhub.info/#/library/) in the navigation menu.
