# MathHub Interoperability

[MathHub.info](https://mathhub.info) serves three main purposes:

1.  to *conserve the legacy* of the semi-formal material produced by the
    academic community and protect it from eventualities like disk
    crashes or the retirement of professors.
2.  to act as a *neutral meeting ground* for researchers and clearing
    house, where the *state of the art in
    [[FlexiForms|FlexiForms]]* can be evaluated and individual
    results can be compared.
3.  to act as a *repository for reusable specification components* like
    axiomatizations, theorems, and proofs that can serve as the
    shoulders of giants for individual researchers who reach for the
    stars.

To reach all of these, we need to make the
[[FlexiForms|FlexiForms]] interoperable and interchangeable,
otherwise comparability (2) and reuse (3) is lost and archiving becomes
pointless, if we cannot read the conserved resources (1). To obtain
interoperability, [MathHub](https://mathhub.info) standardizes the
[[FlexiForms|FlexiForms]] to the [â€‹OMDoc](http://omdoc.org)
format. In [MathHub](https://mathhub.info) OMDoc acts as a
theory-neutral representation format that allows to represent the
meta-theoretic foundations of the [[FlexiForms|FlexiForms]] in
the same format and to interlink the foundations at the meta-logical
level. The OMDoc format incorporates a module system geared to support
flexible reuse of specification components via theory morphisms and
views. In particular, the logical foundations of domain representations
in [[FlexiForms|FlexiForms]] can be represented as modules
themselves and can be interlinked via meta-morphisms. This allows to
make [[FlexiForms|FlexiForms]] interoperable at multiple
levels.
