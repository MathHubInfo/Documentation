# MathHub Functionality

*Archiving*: [MathHub](https://mathhub.info) serves as a
system-independent repository that collects knowledge representations of
flexible formality ([FlexiForms](FlexiForms)) from all walks
of life [... more](ContentAreas)

*[FlexiForms](FlexiForms)* are representations of *flexible formality*, they include
specifications from program verification, semantically annotated course materials,
etc. [...  more](FlexiForms).

*Community*: [MathHub.info](https://mathhub.info) is a community portal for discovering,
developing, and discussing, Flexiforms [...  more](community).

*Interoperability*: [MathHub.info](https://mathhub.info) makes all flexiforms
interoperable by encoding them in a theory-neutral representation format that allows to
represent the meta-theoretic foundations with the flexiforms themselves and to interlink
the foundations at the meta-logical level [... more](interoperability).

*Dissemination*: To enhance visibility and create an academic reward system for young
researchers, [MathHub.info](https://mathhub.info) will organize a review system for
[FlexiForms](FlexiForms) akin to the scientific review system. Formalizations will be
ranked with respect to their peer reviews and their reuse factor, they will be
disseminated by a periodical publication highlighting the highest-ranked ones
[... more](dissemination).

*Access*: [MathHub.info](https://mathhub.info) makes the
[FlexiForms](FlexiForms) accessible to both humans and
machines in a variety of formats. It offers high-level support services,
including semantic search, user-adaptive presentation, format
translations, etc [... more](access)

*Intellectual Property*: [MathHub.info](https://mathhub.info) builds on
a solid legal framework: the [Creative
Commons](http://www.creativecommons.org) licenses. The authors retain
copyright and license it to the community, possibly derived works,
commercial use, etc [... more](ip)

*System*: [MathHub.info Architecture](architecture) and
[developer resources](development).
