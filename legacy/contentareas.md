# MathHub Content Areas

## Intended Content

We do not restrict submissions to [MathHub](https://mathhub.info/MathHub).info to a
particular canon of content areas, but only classify the [[FlexiForms|FlexiForms]] by
areas for administration and dissemination. Access to the [MathHub](https://mathhub.info)
content will be possible by [[many other mechanisms?|access]].

[MathHub](https://mathhub.info) content areas will largely be determined
by submissions. The initial list presented below should just serve as a
template:

  - *Logics*, these serve as the meta-theoretic foundation for the
    formal systems underlying the [[FlexiForms|FlexiForms]].
  - *Mathematical Foundations*, made semi-formal are used to specify and reason about the
    mathematical domain vocabulary of many Flexiforms.
  - *Programming*
  - *The Real World*, this is the current catch-all for everything we cannot fit into the
    first three categories.

## Actual Content on MathHub.info

The content is organized in [[libaries|libraries]], which are overseen and approved by the
[[MathHub library commitee|library-committee]]. The set of libraries in MathHub can be
found [here](https://mathhub.info/#/library).
