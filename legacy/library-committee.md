# MathHub Library Committee

[[MathHub](https://mathhub.info) [libraries|libraries]] are
public resources of flexiformal documents usually developed and
maintained by a community.

MathHub libraries ([current list](https://mathhub.info/#/library))
are established by the **MathHub library committee**, which also liaises
with the community that develops, curates, and maintains the resource
corresponding to the library.

The MathHub library committee currently consists of:

1.  Prof. Dr. [Michael Kohlhase](http://kwarc.info/kohlhase), [Computer Science, FAU
    Erlangen-Nürnberg](https://www.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/) (chair;
    informal libraries)
2.  Dr. habil. [Florian Rabe](http://kwarc.info/frabe), [Computer Science, FAU
    Erlangen-Nürnberg](https://www.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/) and LRI, Paris Sud (formal libraries).

To propose a library or archive for addition contact the library
committee and specify the contribution to the MathHub ecosystem (why
should MathHub manage and display it), the intended content (what
is/will be there), and who will be responsible.

The committee can be reached via the mailing list
`library-committee@mathhub.info`
